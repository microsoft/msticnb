Creating Notebooklets
=====================

Most of the process of creating a notebook is documented in the
`nb_template <https://github.com/microsoft/msticnb/blob/master/msticnb/nb/template/nb_template.py>`_ module.
You can use this as a starting point for creating a notebooklet.

Notebooklets have two components:

- A python module containing the code that does all of the processing
  work that you'd normally write directly into notebook cells.
- A YAML file that contains configuration, documentation and text
  content that you want to display as part of your notebooklet's output.

Custom notebooklets must be in a package of their own (although you
can have multiple notebooklets in the same package) so also require
an ``__init__.py`` in the same folder.

Notebooklets are loaded by calling ``nb.discover_modules()`` function
and specifying the path to the notebooklets package with the ``nb_path``
parameter.
(see :py:func:`discover_modules<msticnb.read_modules.discover_modules>`)

See later sections: `Creating a Template Notebooklet`_ and
`Importing Custom Notebooklets`_

Notebooklet module
------------------
The notebooklet module has three main sections:

- **Result class definition**:
  This defines the attributes and descriptions of the data that you
  want to return from the notebooklet.
- **Notebooklet class definition**:
  This is the entry point for running the notebooklet. At minimum
  it should be a class derived from Notebooklet that implements
  a `run` method and returns your result class.
- **Functions**:
  These do most of the work of the notebooklet and usually the code
  that is copied from or adapted from the original notebook.

Having the latter section is optional. You can choose to implement
this functionality in instance methods of the notebooklet class.

However, there are advantages to keeping these as separate functions
outside the class. It means that all the data used in the functions
has to be passed around as parameters and return values. This can
improve the clarity of the code and reduce errors due to some
dependency on some mysterious global state.

If the user of your notebooklet wants to import the module's code
into a notebook to read and possibly adapt it, having standalone
functions will make it easier from them understand and work with
the code.

Results Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is derived from the
:py:class:`NotebookletResult<msticnb.notebooklet.NotebookletResult>`
It is also an `attrs class <https://www.attrs.org>`_ so needs to be
decorated with the @attr decorator.

.. code:: python

    @attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
    class TemplateResult(NotebookletResult):
        """
        Template Results.

        Attributes
        ----------
        all_events : pd.DataFrame
            DataFrame of all raw events retrieved.
        plot : bokeh.models.LayoutDOM
            Bokeh plot figure showing the account events on an
            interactive timeline.
        additional_info: dict
            Additional information for my notebooklet.

        """

        description: str = "Windows Host Security Events"

        # Add attributes as needed here.
        # Make sure they are documented in the Attributes section
        # above.
        all_events: pd.DataFrame = None
        plot: Figure = None
        additional_info: Optional[dict] = None

The class is just a collection of attributes containing results that
you want to return to the user. It is a good idea to add type hints that
define what data type each attribute contains. Adding documentation for
each attribute is important. This not only helps when reading the code
or using the Python help() function but it is also used to automatically
generate titles and descriptive text when you display the results class.

The Notebooklet class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The notebooklet class is the main engine behind a notebooklet. It is
derived from
:py:class:`Notebooklet<msticnb.notebooklet.Notebooklet>`

.. code:: python

    class TemplateNB(Notebooklet):
        """
        Template Notebooklet class.

        Detailed description of things this notebooklet does:

        - Fetches all events from XYZ
        - Plots interesting stuff
        - Returns extended metadata about the thing

        Document the options that the Notebooklet takes, if any,
        Use these control which parts of the notebooklet get run.

        """
        # assign metadata from YAML to class variable
        metadata = _CLS_METADATA
        __doc__ = nb_metadata.update_class_doc(__doc__, metadata)
        _cell_docs = _CELL_DOCS

The first section of the the class definition contains the docstring.
This documentation is used by the notebooklet browser and the
show_help() function to provide extended user-friendly help.

The first three lines of code handle assigning metadata and documentation
data from the notebooklet YAML file (see below) so that the notebooklet
code can access it.

.. warning:: Do not change these lines unless you know what you are doing.

The run method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:py:func:`Notebooklet.run<msticnb.notebooklet.Notebooklet.run>`

The next section is the all-important ``run`` method. This method is the
main entry point to the notebooklet and controls the flow of most of the
logic. You can add other methods to do subsequent tasks but you should
always implement a run method.

.. code:: python

    # @set_text decorator will display the title and text every time
    # this method is run.
    # The key value refers to an entry in the `output` section of
    # the notebooklet yaml file.
    @set_text(docs=_CELL_DOCS, key="run")
    def run(
        self,
        value: Any = None,
        data: Optional[pd.DataFrame] = None,
        timespan: Optional[TimeSpan] = None,
        options: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> TemplateResult:
        """
        Return XYZ summary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : str
            Host name - The key for searches - e.g. host, account, IPaddress
        data : Optional[pd.DataFrame], optional
            Alternatively use a DataFrame as input.
        timespan : TimeSpan
            Timespan for queries
        options : Optional[Iterable[str]], optional
            List of options to use, by default None.
            A value of None means use default options.
            Options prefixed with "+" will be added to the default options.
            To see the list of available options type `help(cls)` where
            "cls" is the notebooklet class or an instance of this class.

        Returns
        -------
        TemplateResult
            Result object with attributes for each result type.

        Raises
        ------
        MsticnbMissingParameterError
            If required parameters are missing

        """

Most of this is class documentation - again this is used in the browser
and user help so you should document this as shown. Usually you can just
copy and paste this example and edit the text to suit your needs - for
example, changing the description ``value`` if you are expecting an IP
address.

Do not rename or add to these explicit parameters since they are referenced
by the base class. If you want additional parameters you can supply them
as keyword arguments and extract them from kwargs. Be sure to document
any keyword arguments that you require.

The set_text decorator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``@set_text`` decorator requires some explanation. This decorator
gives you the ability to output display text every time ``run()`` is called.
It references the _CELL_DOCS dictionary, which is read from the YAML metadata
file, and specifies a key which is used to look up the exact section from the
file to use.

You can optionally add explicit title and text as parameters to ``set_text``
using the ``title``, ``text`` and ``hd_level`` parameters.
This is documented here :py:func:`set_text<msticnb.common.set_text>`

The set_text decorator does not display any text if you run the notebooklet
with ``silent=True`` parameter.

The run method body
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    # This line use logic in the superclass to populate options
    # (including default options) into this class.
    super().run(
        value=value, data=data, timespan=timespan, options=options, **kwargs
    )

Calling the base class ``run`` method from your implementation is important.
This does things like handle options and convert and normalize the timespan
parameter.

The next section validates any input parameters that you require and creates
a results class to store your output data.
Assigning the description and the timespan being used to the results object
is very helpful when you need to refer back to the result or possibly make
additional ad hoc queries afterwards.

.. code:: python

    if not value:
        raise MsticnbMissingParameterError("value")
    if not timespan:
        raise MsticnbMissingParameterError("timespan.")

    # Create a result class
    result = TemplateResult()
    result.description = self.metadata.description
    result.timespan = timespan


The remainder of the run method is just about the logic of what you
want to execute and in what order.

.. note:: be sure to assign your results class to ``self._last_result``.
   This will expose the result class as a ``result`` property of your
   notebooklet instance and allow other methods in your class to reference
   it.

.. code:: python

    # You might want to always do some tasks irrespective of
    # options sent
    all_events_df = _get_all_events(
        self.query_provider, host_name=value, timespan=timespan
    )
    result.all_events = all_events_df

    if "plot_events" in self.options:
        result.plot = _display_event_timeline(acct_event_data=all_events_df)

    if "get_metadata" in self.options:
        result.additional_info = _get_metadata(host_name=value, timespan=timespan)

    # Assign the result to the _last_result attribute
    # so that you can get to it without having to re-run the operation
    self._last_result = result  # pylint: disable=attribute-defined-outside-init

    return self._last_result


You can call additional methods unconditionally or use the option logic to
allow users to add additional operations or skip ones that they are not
interested in. The available and default options for your notebooklet are defined in
the notebooklet YAML file.

If you call run() without specifying the options parameter, the defaults will be
used. You can specify a custom set of options as a list of option names (strings).

``options=["opt1", "opt2", "opt4"]``

You can also specify an incremental list. For example:

- ``options=["+option_a"]`` will add "option_a" to the list of default options.
- ``options=["+option_a", "-option_b"]`` will add "option_a" and remove "option_b"
  from the defaults.

.. note:: You cannot mix the explicit options with the incremental options syntax.

Be sure to assign the output from the called functions to the relevant
attributes of your result and return the result at the end.

Additional notebooklet methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often you will not want to or not be able to execute additional functionality
within the run command. You may require the user to choose an option before
starting a second step or you may want to provide some kind of data browsing
capability that is interactive and needs to the run method to have completed.

You can do this by adding methods to your notebooklet class. Any public
methods you create will be added to the auto-documentation of the notebooklet.

This is an example method. Note that if you depend on the result being
populated, you should check this and issue a warning if it is not (as shown).

.. code:: python

    def run_additional_operation(
        self, event_ids: Optional[Union[int, Iterable[int]]] = None
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Addition method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event_ids : Optional[Union[int, Iterable[int]]], optional
            Single or interable of event IDs (ints).

        Returns
        -------
        pd.DataFrame
            Results with expanded columns.

        """
        # Include this to check the "run()" has happened before this method
        # can be run
        if (
            not self._last_result or self._last_result.all_events is None
        ):  # type: ignore
            print(
                "Please use 'run()' to fetch the data before using this method.",
                "\nThen call 'expand_events()'",
            )
            return None
        # Print a status message - this will not be displayed if
        # the user has set the global "verbose" option to False.
        nb_print("We maybe about to wait some time")

        nb_markdown("Print some message that always displays", "blue, bold")
        return _do_additional_thing(
            evt_df=self._last_result.all_events,  # type: ignore
            event_ids=event_ids,
        )
        # Note you can also assign new items to the result class in
        # self._last_result and return the updated result class.

One thing to note here is the use of
:py:func:`nb_markdown<msticnb.common.nb_markdown>`
and :py:func:`nb_print<msticnb.common.nb_print>` (there is
also an :py:func:`nb_display<msticnb.common.nb_display>` function). These are
simple wrappers around IPython.display.markdown(), Python print() and
IPython.display.display(). These functions honor the ``silent`` parameter.
This can be supplied to the notebooklet ``__init__`` method (when
creating an instance of the class) or the ``run`` method. If silent is True
then these functions do not display any output. You are free to use whatever
output functions you choose but the notebooklet may produce unexpected
output if the user has set the silent option to True.

.. note:: You can access ``self.silent`` to query the current setting.
          You can also set the silent option globally by using
          ``nb.set_opt("silent", True)``
          (see :py:func:`set_opt<msticnb.options.set_opt>`)

Worker Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep the notebooklet class simple, most of the work done by the notebooklet
is usually coded in separate module functions. These are usually declares as
private functions by prefixing with "_"

This simple function executes a query and returns the results. The
query provider, hostname and timespan are supplied in the call from the
notebooklet run method.

.. code:: python3

    def _get_all_events(qry_prov, host_name, timespan):
        # Tell the user that you're fetching data
        # (doesn't display if nb.set_opt("silent", True))
        nb_data_wait("SecurityEvent")
        return qry_prov.WindowsSecurity.list_host_events(
            timespan,
            host_name=host_name,
            add_query_items="| where EventID != 4688 and EventID != 4624",
        )

:py:func:`nb_data_wait<msticnb.common.nb_data_wait>` just outputs a
standard message telling the user that data is being retrieved.

This is another example showing the use of the ``@set_text`` decorator.
The output from this will be displayed as the plot is shown. The plot
layout object is returned to the notebooklet class and added to the
results class (shown earlier).

.. code:: python3

    @set_text(docs=_CELL_DOCS, key="display_event_timeline")
    def _display_event_timeline(acct_event_data):
        # Plot events on a timeline

        # Note the nbdisplay function is a wrapper around IPython.display()
        # However, it honors the "silent" option (global or per-notebooklet)
        # which allows you to suppress output while running.
        return nbdisplay.display_timeline(
            data=acct_event_data,
            group_by="EventID",
            source_columns=["Activity", "Account"],
            legend="right",
        )

Notebook YAML file
------------------

The notebooklet YAML file should have the same name as the Python module but
with a "yaml" or "yml" extension.

There are two main sections: ``metadata`` and ``output``.

.. code:: YAML

    metadata:
        name: TemplateNB
        description: Template YAML for Notebooklet
        default_options:
            - all_events: Gets all events about blah
            - plot_events:
                Display and summary and timeline of events.
        other_options:
            - get_metadata: fetches additional metadata about the entity
        keywords:
            - host
            - computer
            - heartbeat
            - windows
            - account
        entity_types:
            - host
        req_providers:
            - AzureSentinel|LocalData
            - tilookup

The metadata section defines runtime parameters for the notebooklet. These
include:

- the notebooklet display name
- the notebooklet description
- the default options (a list of key/value pairs of option name and description)
- other options available
- keywords (used in searching for the notebooklet
- entity types - mainly informational so that a user can find all notebooklets
  that deal with hosts, IP addresses, etc.
- req_providers - this is a list of data providers required for the notebooklet
  to run. You can provide alternates (as shown), which means that if one of the
  providers is available the notebooklet will load successfully.


.. code:: YAML

    output:
        run:
            title: Title for the run method (main title)
            hd_level: 1
            text:
            Write your introductory text here

            Data and plots are stored in the result class returned by this function.

            If you use **markdown** syntax in this block add the following
            to use markdown processing.
            md: True
        display_event_timeline:
            title: Display the timeline.
            text: '
            This may take some time to complete for large numbers of events.

            It will do:
            - Item one
            - Item two

            Since some groups will be undefined these can show up as `NaN`.

            Note: use a quoted string if you want to include yaml reserved chars
            such as ":"
            '
            md: True

The output section defines the display text for the ``@set_text`` decorator
function used in the notebooklet module. The key for each section under output
must match the value for the ``key`` parameter in the call to ``set_text``.

Each section has the following sub-keys:

- title: the title to display (by default as HTML h2 or Markdown "##")
- hd_level: (1-4) to override the default heading level
- text: the body text to display. This will display as plain text by default
- md: set to True to process the "text" value as Markdown.

Creating a Template Notebooklet
-------------------------------

MSTIC Notebooklets has a function that creates a skeleton notebooklet module
and yaml file for you. Use the skeleton to add your own functionality
that can be imported into msticnb at runtime

.. code:: python3

    import msticnb as nb

    nb.create_template(nb_name="MyNotebooklet", folder="mynotebooklet")

This will create a module (mynotebooklet.py) and yaml (mynotebooklet.yaml)
in the mynotebooklet directory. The notebooklet and results class
are named MyNotebooklet and MyNotebookletResult, respectively.

You should normally create notebooklets in their own folder (although
you can have several uniquely named notebooklet modules in the same folder).

.. note:: This method is primarily for creating standalone custom notebooklet
    that are intended to be imported into the msticnb package at runtime.
    If you are creating a notebooklet to check in to the msticnb project
    use the :py:class:`msticnb.nb.template.nbtemplate`` class as a starting point
    instead.

:py:func:`create_notebooklet <msticnb.template.create_notebooklet>` has
some optional parameters:

- author (str) - the Author name to put in the notebooklet Python module, by default "Author"
- subfolder (bool) - If True create a subfolder (of the parameter ``folder`` or the
  current directory, if ``folder`` is not specified. The foldername will the same as
  the notebooklet module (the ``nb_name``) parameter, converted to lowercase. If
  False, the template files are written to the ``folder`` directory.
- overwrite (bool) - if True, ``create_template`` will overwrite existing files
  with the same name. The default is False.



Importing Custom Notebooklets
-----------------------------

Your custom notebooklets should be collected in a folder. They can also be
in multiple folders or in nested sub-folders.

Use the :py:func:`msticnb.read_modules.discover_modules` function.

.. code:: python3

    import msticnb as nb
    nb.discover_modules(nb_path="./custom")


``discover_modules`` will search all modules in the specified folder
and find any modules with classes derived from
:py:class:`msticnb.notebooklet.Notebooklet`. These are imported into the
nb.nblts collection and can be used from notebooks.

You can also specify a list of paths for the ``nb_path`` parameter.

.. code:: python3

    import msticnb as nb
    nb.discover_modules(nb_path=["./custom", "./custom2"])
